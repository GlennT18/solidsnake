***Pip install colorist***

This is just a CLI game that I made in my free time
There are multiple levels that the user can play(1-3)
Controls:
  W -> Up
  A -> Left
  S -> Down
  D -> Right

The objective of the game is to move your character
through the level and reach the "*" tile.

While navigating to the "*", you have to avoid the guards
who will shine lights in circular motions. If the user
steps into the light they will be considered "caught"
and the game ends.
